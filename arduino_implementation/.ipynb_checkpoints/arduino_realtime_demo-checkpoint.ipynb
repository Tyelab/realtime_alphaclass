    "### Establish a link to the Arduino: pySerialTransfer\n",
    "`pySerialTransfer` is a package that allows for rapid serial (over USB) communication from Python to any Arduino board. To start a connection, the Arduino must first be connected to a computer by a USB-B cable. The connection will be held open by a `while True` statement. The package uses a function called `SerialTransfer()` which takes the following arguments:\n",
    "1. COM port of the computer\n",
    "2. BAUD rate or bit-communication rate\n",
    "3. A true/false debug argument\n",
    "Storing the `transfer` object as a variable allows us to call different properties. It is commonly saved as `link`. The link to the Arduino is then opened by:\n",
    "- `link.open()`\n",
    "\n",
    "With the link open, we create a transfer object through `tx_obj()` which simply takes the variable we want to transmit. In this case, the behavior code. The `tx_obj` returns a `packet` of information that's sent as a series of bytes the Arduino knows how to interpet. This must be saved as a variable that we can send:\n",
    "- `behavior_size = link.tx_obj(behavior)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we send the behavior code using `send()`:\n",
    "- `link.send(behavior_size)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino has been coded to interpet each behavior code and turn on a specific LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you wish for the demo to end, you can hit `Ctrl+C` to exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate Random Numbers\n",
    "In this demo, the behavior codes are created by a random number generator called by `randint()` which generates a random number in the range specified. In our case, integers from 0 - 3.\n",
